<h1 align="center">GitHub-Shared-Workflows</h1>

This GitHub Shared Workflows offers benefits such as code reusability, consistent processes, simplified maintenance, easy updates and upgrades and easier troubleshooting. By adopting shared workflows, we can make workflows reusable and anyone with access to the Shared workflow can then call the Shared workflow from another workflow when require. This repository contains GitHub Shared Workflows that build, security scanning, and deployment processes for SST Application, Docker images and Helm charts. For more information please follow below [Table of Content](https://github.com/clouddrove/github-shared-workflows/tree/issue_357#-table-of-content).
