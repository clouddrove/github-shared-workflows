This GitHub Shared Workflows offers benefits such as code reusability, consistent processes, simplified maintenance, easy updates and upgrades and easier troubleshooting. By adopting shared workflows, we can make workflows reusable and anyone with access to the Shared workflow can then call the Shared workflow from another workflow when require. This repository contains GitHub Shared Workflows that build, security scanning, and deployment processes for SST Application, Docker images, Helm charts and more. For more information please follow below [Table of Content](https://github.com/clouddrove/github-shared-workflows/tree/master#-table-of-content).

## Example
```yaml
jobs:
  staging: # Job name
    uses: clouddrove/github-shared-workflows/.github/workflows/sst_workflow.yml@master
    secrets:
      SECRET_1:
      SECRET_2: 
    with:
      input_1:                 
      input_2:
```
Above example calls SST workflow from `clouddrove/github-shared-workflows/.github/workflows/sst_workflow.yml@master` and used in the jobs as per our requirement for deployment.
