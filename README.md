This repo offers to using a workflow with a simple calling structure and proper documentation. This shared workflow feature can overcome the issue of upgrading hundreds of workflows whenever any new updation is required. In this repo, we have many kinds of workflows related to Terraform, Kubernetes, Helm, SST, and regular workflows like maintain changelog, auto assignee, and many more.

## How shared workflow use
```yaml
jobs:
  staging: # Job name
    uses: clouddrove/github-shared-workflows/.github/workflows/example.yml@master
    secrets:
      SECRET_1:
      SECRET_2: 
    with:
      input_1:                 
      input_2:
```
Above example is just a simple example to call workflow from github shared workflow to your workflow and used in the jobs as per your requirements.
