## [Tag Release](https://github.com/clouddrove/github-shared-workflows/blob/master/.github/workflows/tag-release.yml)
This reusable workflow automatically bumps semantic version tags (X.Y.Z) and generates a categorized changelog on every PR merge, based on PR labels.
Release notes include a compare link.
It utilizes the workflows defined in `.github/workflows/tag-release.yml`

### Features

- Label-driven versioning based on semantic versioning  
- Automatic changelog generation  
- Auto-tagging with `x.y.z` format  
- Skips tagging when needed via label  

By default, the first release starts at **`1.0.0`**. After that, all new releases are created based on the label applied to the PR.  

### Label Behavior

Before merging a PR, apply one of the following labels to control the version bump:

| Label   | Effect on Version        | Example Change |
|---------|--------------------------|----------------|
| major   | Increases major version  | 1.2.3 → 2.0.0  |
| minor   | Increases minor version  | 1.2.3 → 1.3.0  |
| patch   | Increases patch version  | 1.2.3 → 1.2.4  |
| no-tag  | No new tag or release    | (skips tagging) |
