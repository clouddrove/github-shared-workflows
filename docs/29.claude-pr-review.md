## Claude Code PR Checks Workflow


This reusable workflow integrates Anthropic Claude to automatically review Pull Requests and provide feedback using inline comments and a summary review.

The Claude Code Review action is triggered when the workflow is called from another workflow using workflow_call.

#### Usage

- Regular PR checks (e.g., repo checkout)

- Claude Code review with configurable prompt

- Inline and summary feedback on PRs
