## [Prowler Workflow GCP](https://github.com/clouddrove/github-shared-workflows/blob/master/.github/workflows/prowlerGCP.yml)
Prowler an open cloud security platform for our cloud environment. We get a complete report of our cloud infra.

### Usage
This workflow is used to run a Prowler scan on your GCP cloud infrastructure. You can choose to upload the scan reports to a GCS bucket, or disable that option â€” in which case, the reports will be available as downloadable GitHub Artifacts at the end of the workflow.

The workflow supports scanning multiple GCP projects by providing a comma-separated list of project IDs. You can also enable Slack notifications to receive updates when the workflow completes. For authentication, it supports both GCP Service Account Key JSON and Workload Identity Federation (WIF), giving you flexibility based on your security setup.
