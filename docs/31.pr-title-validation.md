## [PR Title Validation Workflow](https://github.com/clouddrove/github-shared-workflows/blob/master/.github/workflows/pr-title-validation.yml)

This workflow is used to **validate Pull Request titles** using GitHub Actions.
It enforces a standardized PR title format (for example: `feat:`, `fix:`, `docs:`) to maintain consistency across repositories.

## Usage

The PR Title Validation workflow is automatically triggered on Pull Request events such as:

- opened
- edited
- synchronized
- reopened

To use this shared workflow, add the following workflow definition to your repository:

```
.github/workflows/pr-title-validation.yml
```

---

## Example Usage

```yaml
name: PR Validation

on:
  pull_request:
    types: [opened, edited, synchronize, reopened]

jobs:
  pr-title-validation:
    uses: clouddrove/github-shared-workflows/.github/workflows/pr-title-validation.yml@master

```

---

## Example with Custom Regex (Optional)

You can override the default PR title regex if your repository follows a different convention (for example, enforcing JIRA tickets).

```yaml
name: PR Validation

on:
  pull_request:
    types: [opened, edited, synchronize, reopened]

jobs:
  pr-title-validation:
    uses: clouddrove/github-shared-workflows/.github/workflows/pr-title-validation.yml@master
    with:
      regex: '^(feat|fix|docs|chore|refactor|ci|test)\([A-Z]+-[0-9]+\): '

```

### Example Valid PR Titles

```
feat: add user login flow
fix: resolve memory leak
docs: update README

```
