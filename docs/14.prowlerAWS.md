## [Prowler Workflow](https://github.com/clouddrove/github-shared-workflows/blob/master/.github/workflows/14.prowlerAWS.yml)
Prowler an open cloud security platform for our cloud environment. We get a complete report of our cloud infra.

### Usage
This workflow is used to run Prowler scan on your cloud infra for AWS. In the Workflow you can choose to send your report to your S3 Bucket or you can also disable that and at the end of the workflow you will get a Artifact which you can download. You can also enable the feature of Security Hub which will send the findings into your account. It also supports Multi-AWS account.
