## Slack Notification Workflow

#### [Slack alert workflow reference](https://github.com/clouddrove/github-shared-workflows/blob/master/.github/workflows/slack.yml)

#### Overview

This reusable Slack notification workflow provides standardized alerting for GitHub Actions jobs, especially designed to notify about github workflow operations such as who triggered the workflow & is it successfully created or failed.

It supports sending messages to Slack channels or users using the Slack API with rich formatting, interactive buttons, and customizable fields.

#### Usage

You can integrate this workflow into your own GitHub Actions by calling it via the uses: directive. This workflow simplifies sending Slack notifications by handling authentication, message formatting, and error handling for you.
