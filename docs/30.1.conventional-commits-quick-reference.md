# Conventional Commits Quick Reference

A quick reference guide for developers using Conventional Commits in CloudDrove projects.

## Commit Message Format

```
<type>[optional scope]: <description>

[optional body]

[optional footer(s)]
```

## Commit Types

| Type | Description | Version Bump |
|------|-------------|--------------|
| `feat` | New feature | Minor |
| `fix` | Bug fix | Patch |
| `docs` | Documentation | Patch |
| `style` | Code style (formatting, etc.) | Patch |
| `refactor` | Code refactoring | Patch |
| `perf` | Performance improvement | Patch |
| `test` | Adding/updating tests | Patch |
| `chore` | Maintenance tasks | Patch |
| `ci` | CI/CD changes | Patch |
| `build` | Build system changes | Patch |
| `revert` | Reverting changes | Patch |

## Breaking Changes

Use `!` after type/scope or include `BREAKING CHANGE:` in footer:

```
feat!: redesign API
# or
feat: redesign API

BREAKING CHANGE: API endpoints have changed
```

## Examples

### Basic Commits
```bash
feat: add user authentication
fix: resolve memory leak in cache
docs: update API documentation
style: format code with prettier
refactor: simplify user service
perf: optimize database queries
test: add unit tests for auth
chore: update dependencies
ci: add automated testing
build: update webpack config
```

### With Scopes
```bash
feat(api): add user authentication
fix(ui): resolve button click issue
docs(readme): update installation guide
style(components): format with prettier
refactor(services): simplify user service
perf(database): optimize queries
test(auth): add unit tests
chore(deps): update dependencies
ci(github): add automated testing
build(webpack): update configuration
```

### With Body and Footer
```bash
feat(api): add user authentication

Implement JWT-based authentication with login and registration endpoints.
Includes password hashing and token validation.

Closes #123
```

### Breaking Changes
```bash
feat!: redesign user API

BREAKING CHANGE: The user API endpoints have been completely redesigned.
All existing API calls will need to be updated.

Migration guide: https://docs.example.com/migration
```

## PR Title Format

PR titles should follow the same format as commit messages:

```
feat: add user authentication system
fix(ui): resolve button click issue
docs: update API documentation
```

## Common Scopes

- `api` - API changes
- `ui` - User interface changes
- `docs` - Documentation changes
- `config` - Configuration changes
- `deploy` - Deployment changes
- `infra` - Infrastructure changes
- `test` - Test-related changes
- `build` - Build system changes

## Best Practices

1. **Use imperative mood**: "add feature" not "added feature"
2. **Keep description under 50 characters**
3. **Capitalize first letter of description**
4. **Don't end description with period**
5. **Use body to explain what and why, not how**
6. **Reference issues in footer**
7. **Be consistent with scopes across the project**

## Quick Commands

### Check commit format
```bash
# Validate your commit message
echo "feat: add new feature" | npx commitlint
```

### Generate changelog
```bash
# Generate changelog from commits
npx conventional-changelog -p angular -i CHANGELOG.md -s
```

### Bump version
```bash
# Bump version based on commits
npx standard-version
```

## Troubleshooting

### Commit validation fails
- Check format: `type: description`
- Ensure type is allowed
- Verify scope is allowed (if configured)

### PR title validation fails
- Use same format as commits
- Check type and scope are allowed

### Release not created
- Ensure commits are conventional format
- Check GitHub token permissions
- Verify commits since last release
